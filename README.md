# Stroke Prediction EDA & Modeling

This my first project after learning 9 weeks in dibimbing.id. This project about Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling with K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, decision tree and random forest of the Stroke Prediction Dataset.

Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

## **Insights & Summary**
* Dataset mostly has categorical variables.
* Data is mostly normally distributed.
* Imbalanced dataset, balancing using oversampling method(with SMOTE).
* Random Forest is the model with the best accuracy and recall.
